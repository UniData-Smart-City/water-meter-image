# Water Meter Pics - 5,000+ photos
Dataset comprises **5,000+** photos of water meters, including high-quality images, **segmentation masks**, and **OCR** labels for meter readings. Each entry provides detailed information such as the meter reading value, **bounding box** coordinates, and segmentation data, making it ideal for training models in **utility management, automatic meter reading (AMR), and water usage analysis**.- **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/water-meters/?utm_source=github-sc&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=water-meter-image)**
